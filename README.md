# Go utilities for Pulumi

[![PkgGoDev](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/gwatts/pulutil)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gwatts/pulutil)

Some utilities I have written to make working with [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com) a little easier.

* [Policy](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gwatts/pulutil/policy/) - A helper for building IAM policy documents
* [Template](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gwatts/pulutil/template/) - Makes it easier to use Go templates with Pulumi outputs.  Eg. for generating JSON documents with resource ids, Urns, etc within them.
